# Universe Database

This project sets up a PostgreSQL database called `universe` that models a fictional universe containing galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and black holes. The schema includes tables for each entity, along with sequences for primary key generation, constraints, and some sample data.

## Project Overview

The database consists of the following tables:

- **blackhole**: Represents black holes with attributes like `blackhole_id`, `gravity`, `galaxy_id`, `wormhole`, and `name`.
- **galaxy**: Contains information about galaxies with fields including `galaxy_id`, `speed`, `description`, `name`, and `rotation_speed`.
- **moon**: Represents moons, with attributes like `moon_id`, `name`, `has_water`, `planet_id`, and `name_code`.
- **planet**: Contains data about planets, including `planet_id`, `name`, `amount_of_people`, `time_travel`, and `star_id`.
- **star**: Represents stars with fields such as `star_id`, `radius`, `color`, `name`, and `galaxy_id`.

### Key Features

- **Primary Keys and Sequences**: Each table has a primary key generated by sequences to ensure unique identification of records.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: The database enforces referential integrity with foreign keys:
  - A star belongs to a galaxy.
  - A planet orbits a star.
  - A moon orbits a planet.
- **Unique Constraints**: The `name` field in most tables is unique to avoid duplication of celestial bodies.
- **Sample Data**: The database includes sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this database locally:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your system.
2. Download the `universe.sql` file from this repository.
3. Create a new database in PostgreSQL using the following command:
   ```bash
   createdb universe
   ```
4. Import the database schema and data:
   ```bash
   psql -U <your_username> -d universe -f universe.sql
   ```
5. Once imported, you can connect to the `universe` database using your favorite PostgreSQL client to explore and query the data.

## Usage

This database can be used as a foundation for:

- Educational purposes to learn about PostgreSQL databases.
- Expanding into a more detailed space exploration or astronomy project.
- Serving as a backend database for a science fiction-themed application.

### Example Queries

- List all galaxies:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM galaxy;
  ```

- Find all planets orbiting the star named "beatlejuice":
  ```sql
  SELECT planet.name 
  FROM planet 
  JOIN star ON planet.star_id = star.star_id 
  WHERE star.name = 'beatlejuice';
  ```

- Get all moons that have water:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM moon WHERE has_water = true;
  ```
